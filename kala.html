<h3>Kala Alexander</h3>
<p>Go Fishing Hawaii is owned and operated by professional waterman and actor Kala Alexander. Kala is a born and raised native Hawaiian and has surfed and fished the waters of Hawaii his entire life. He is also one of only 28 big wave specialists invited to compete in the “Eddie Aikau Big Wave Memorial” held at Waimea Bay which has a minimum wave height requirement of forty feet to be held. As a matter of fact, last year it was held in 40-60 foot surf. Kala’s exploits, like many waterman before him, have opened other doors. He actually played himself in the feature film “Blue Crush” ,which was shot entirely here on the northshore, and currently has a recurring role on the hit TV show “Hawaii 5-0.”</p>
